You don’t even need to make\nthe spreadsheet public since the scripts can run under your own permissions.</p>\n<p>Here’s how it works:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The User is prompted to enter their name.</li>\n<li>The page sends a request to a script that checks the name against the guest list. (App Script #1)</li>\n<li>If we’re able to find the user, prompt the rest of the form questions.</li>\n<li>Once the user submits, make a request to a second script that records the information. (App Script #2)</li>\n</ol>\n<p><a href=\"https://script.google.com/d/1koKbzUqZyLHREU2J36KJsmy6mlg3VIY7d1ezZyyBYzMPCyB5N5N1Ibh8\">Script 1: The Guest List Checker</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://script.google.com/d/1d5r0QPaxoDiBUt9RljSs7gdKAV0-BTaXf_3k-SVALGZl99i8h-2t0Ywr\">Script 2: The RSVP Recorder</a></p>\n<p>Other features I missed:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Editing the RSVP: In the current setup, guests can edit their responses by\nresubmitting. Unfortunately, I don’t prepopulate the form with the current response.\nI think the risk here is that it would expose the guest attendance and notes to anyone who\nknows their name. I decided that just being able to resend the RSVP should be sufficient.</li>\n</ul>","frontmatter":{"title":"Guest Lists and RSVPs With Google Sheets","date":"January 13, 2019"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/wedding-rsvp-using-google-forms/","previous":null,"next":null}}
