You don’t even need to make\nthe spreadsheet public since the scripts can run under your own permissions.</p>\n<p>Here’s the flow I wanted for my RSVPs:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The user is prompted to enter their name.</li>\n<li>The page sends a request to a script that checks the name against the guest list. (Script #1)</li>\n<li>If we’re able to find the user, prompt the rest of the form questions.</li>\n<li>Once the user submits, make a request to a second script that records the information. (Script #2)</li>\n</ol>\n<p><a href=\"https://script.google.com/d/1koKbzUqZyLHREU2J36KJsmy6mlg3VIY7d1ezZyyBYzMPCyB5N5N1Ibh8/edit?usp=sharing\">Script 1: The Guest List Checker</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://script.google.com/d/1d5r0QPaxoDiBUt9RljSs7gdKAV0-BTaXf_3k-SVALGZl99i8h-2t0Ywr/edit?usp=sharing\">Script 2: The RSVP Response Recorder</a></p>\n<p>You can check out the <a href=\"https://github.com/cixzhang/cixzhang.github.io/blob/develop/src/components/wedding/RSVPForm.js\">form component</a> to see how this is all tied together!</p>\n<p><strong>Note on the structure of the spreadsheet</strong></p>\n<p>My spreadsheet contains a sheet named “RSVP”. The first row of this spreadsheet contains the headers.\nThe scripts will check the position of the “Name” column to check the guest list, and the positions of\nthe ”# Attending” and “Notes” columns for writing the response. If your spreadsheet doesn’t look like\nthis, you’ll need to adjust some lines in the scripts.</p>\n<p><strong>What about editing the RSVP?</strong></p>\n<p>In the current setup, guests can edit their responses by\nresubmitting. Unfortunately, I don’t prepopulate the form with the current response.\nThe risk here is that it would expose the guest attendance and notes to anyone who\nknows their name. I decided that just being able to resend the RSVP should be sufficient.\nIf you want this feature for your own RSVPs, it should be fairly easy to implement.\nYou can reuse <code class=\"language-text\">findResponseRange</code> in the response recorder and return the values.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Guest Lists and RSVPs With Google Sheets","date":"January 13, 2019"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/wedding-rsvp-using-google-forms/","previous":null,"next":null}}
