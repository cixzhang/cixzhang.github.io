I managed to accomplish\nthis by writing 2 App Scripts.</p>\n<p>Here’s how it works:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The User is prompted to enter their name.</li>\n<li>The page sends a request to a script that checks the name against the guest list. (App Script #1)</li>\n<li>If we’re able to find the user, prompt the rest of the form questions.</li>\n<li>Once the user submits, make a request to a second script that records the information. (App Script #2)</li>\n</ol>\n<p><a href=\"https://script.google.com/d/1koKbzUqZyLHREU2J36KJsmy6mlg3VIY7d1ezZyyBYzMPCyB5N5N1Ibh8\">App Script #1</a></p>\n<p>This script was created within the wedding spreadsheet. I’ve got a sheet that’s named “RSVP”\nwhich contained a list of everyone we wanted to invite to the wedding. The script loads\nthe list of names and returns all matches it can find.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://script.google.com/d/1d5r0QPaxoDiBUt9RljSs7gdKAV0-BTaXf_3k-SVALGZl99i8h-2t0Ywr\">App Script #2</a></p>\n<p>Another script that’s linkked to the wedding spreadsheet. It takes in the response and updates the sheet.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Guest Lists and RSVPs With Google Sheets","date":"January 13, 2019"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/wedding-rsvp-using-google-forms/wip/","previous":null,"next":null}}
